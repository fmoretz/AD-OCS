V 1.1: Sulfur Evaluation in the standard way. Derivative is punctual

*** Version 2 ***
 Sulfur evaluated accounting for the maximum of the previous derivatives

V 2.1: Not works properly. Tries to call everything in the ode
V 2.2: CURRENT VERSION. First simulation with AMOCO_HN to get X2 and only then AD_OCS. 

*** Version 3 ***
Oxygen addition

V 3.1: First implementation outside of the ODE, evaluated as PSS CSTR.
