# AD-OCS

PROCESS CONTROL ALGORITHM
REAL TIME DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION ORIENTED

AD_OCS Model with sulfur addition and oxygen implementation

OLD Versions: 

    V1: Amoco_HN, with new and old identification procedure

    Use the folder "WORKING"

    V2: Possible new identification by RMSE minimization

ACTUAL VERSIONS:

Version 3: Sulfur production modeled

Version 4: First modelization of Oxygen, contains only the fluxes

    Version 4.2: Headspace divided in two regions:

    - intephase, where H2S is in equilibrium with the liquid;

    - gas phase, where Oxygen is present and reacts with H2S.

    Version 4.3: Relation of concentrations for kinetics of H2S oxidation

    Version 4.3.1: Fluxes in [mol/d] instead of [mmol/d]

Version 5: Contains the evaluation of VLE, for ideal gases
